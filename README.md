This command verifies all JavaScript files in the project for any code issues and displays the results in the console. The command can be customized with specific options such as specifying a different ESLint configuration file or specifying a directory of files to be checked for linting issues. For more information on using the npm lint command, refer to the official ESLint documentation.

### `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser or send requests.

The console will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
